What is meant by this is that in the tables above, there are 24 different See Also controls. Each control is mapped to one specific See Also keyword. This page should never need to be changed (other than to remove this section so it isn't visible to the end user). Here is how you make this page work. If you double-click the See Also area in your Project Manager view, you will open the See Also designer. You simply associate topics with appropriate See Also keywords. If a topic was added in January, it would be assigned to the NewJan keyword. If it were revised in March, associate it also with the RevMar keyword. When the next January comes around, you just remove the topic from the keyword and assign the topics that apply.","\n  ","Describe the issue in this area.","\n  ","\n\n"],"3":["How-to-Guides","What's Been Revised?"],"5":["January,What's New,See Also,Overview,NewJan,NewJan:assigned,Assigned,Assigned:NewJan,RevMar,Been recently,Project Manager,March,Revised,Page,What's Been Revised,Area"],"id":"7"})
